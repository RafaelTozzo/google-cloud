Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
    Is a secure, individual, private cloud-computing model hosted within a public cloud.
    VPC networks connect Google Cloud resources to each other and to the internet.
    Segmenting networks.
    Using firewall rules to restrict access to instances.
    Creating static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations.
    Google VPC networks are global and can have subnets is any Google Cloud region Worldwide.


    VPC networks:
        Auto subnet mode:
            - One subnet from each region is automatically created
            - Set of predefined IP ranges
            - Comes with default firewall rules 
            - Expandable up to/16 only 
            - Goof for isolated use cases (Proff of concepts(PoCs), testins, etc.)

        Custom subnet mode:
            - No subnets are automatically created 
            - Subnets and IP ranges are defined 
            - No default firewalls rules 
            - Expandable to any RFC 1918 size 
            - Recommende for Production environments

        Public (external) IP addresses:
            - Can be assigned from pool (temporary) or reserved (static).
            - Billed when not attached to a running VM.
            - VM doesn't know the external IP; it's mapped to the internal IP

        Private (interal) IP addresses
            - Allocated from subnet range to VMs by DHCP.
            - DHCP lease is renewed every 24 hours.
            - VM name and IP is registered with network-scoped DNS.

        VPCs do not require a router to be provisioned:
            - Built-in so you don't have to provision or manage a router
            - Used to forward traffic from one instance to another

        VPCs do not require a firewall to be provisioned:
            - Restricts access to instances through both incoming and outgoing traffic 
            - Rules can be defined through metadata tags on Compute Engine instances

        VPC peering and sharing:
            VPC peering:
                A relationship between 2 VPCs can be established to exchange traffic. This opens up space for private 
                RFC 1918 connectivity across 2 VPC networks, no matter whether or not they belong to the same project 
                or the same organization. But don't forget that every VPC network has firewall rules to set what traffic 
                is allowed or denied between networks. VPC Network Peering is a decentralized or distributed technique 
                for multi-project networks because each network remains under the control of a group of administrators
                and maintains its own global firewall and routing tables. Previously these projects used external IP 
                addresses or VPNs to mediate private communication between VPC networks. However, VPC Network Peering 
                does not deal with network latency, the security and expense of using VPNs or external IP addresses.


            VPC shared:
                With a Shared VPC, an organization can connect resources from multiple projects to a common VPC network, 
                resources can communicate with each other securely and efficiently using internal IPs of that network. 
                You need to designate a project as a host and attach one or more service projects to it.
