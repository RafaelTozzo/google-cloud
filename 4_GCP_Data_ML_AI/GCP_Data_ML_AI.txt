Big Data managed services:
    Dataproc:
        - Cost effective
        - Fast and scalable  
        - Large volumes of data
        - Open source ecosystem 
        - Fully managed 
        - Image versioning 
        - Built-in integration
        - Create clusters quickly
        - Process big data with Hadoop/Spark (open source technologies)
            Apache Hadoop:
                - Faster than traditional system 
                - Low Cost 
                - Provides More Authentication 
                - Lengthy and Complex Framework

            Apache Spark:
                - 100 times faster than Hadoop
                - High Cost 
                - Provides fault tolerance through RDD 
                - Simple and User Friendly System 


    Dataflow:
        - Analyze streaming data in real time 
        - Create a pipeline to process data
        - Fully automates operational tasks like resource management and performance optimization.
        - Provides built-in support for falut-tolerant execution 
        - Through the Cloud Console Dataflow provides near-real time statistics such as pipeline
          throughput and lag, and consolidated worker log inspection.
        - Integrates with Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Datastore, Clod Bigtable, and BigQuery for 
          seamless data processing.


    BigQuery:
        - Modernize a data warehouse foundation
        
        - Storage plus analytics:
            A place to store petabytes of data
            A place to analyze data
        
        - Serveless:
            Use SQL queries to answer questions
        
        - Flexixible pay-as-you-go pricing model:
            Pay for what your query processes, or use a flat-rate option
        
        - Data encryption at rest by default:
            Encrypt data stored on a disk, including SSDs and backup media. 
        
        -Built-in machine learning:
            Write ML models directly in BigQuery using SQL

        Patterns to load data into BigQuery:
            - Batch load
            - Streaming 
            - Generated data(SQL)


Automate work with machines:
    AI (Artificial intelligence) vs ML (Machine learning):

    AI (Artificial intelligence): 
        An umbrella term that includes anything related to computers mimicking human intelligence 

    ML (Machine learning): 
        A subset of AI that mainly refers to supervised and unsupervised learning

        Standard algorithm use cases:
            - Detect a pattern in an image
            - Predict the future of a times series 
            - Understand/transcribe human speech/text
        
        ResNet standard algorithm for image classification:
            - Trained ResNet model

        ML options on Google Cloud:
            BigQuery ML:
                Use SQL queries to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery

            Vertex AI:
                - Seamless
                - Scalable 
                - Sustainable 
                - Speedy
                - Provides two solutions in one:
                    AutoML:
                        no-code solution 
                        Create models
                        Manage models 
                        Deploy models 

                    Custom training:
                        code-based solution
                        Code your own ML environment to have the control over the ML pipeline.

            Pre-build APIs:
                Leverage ML models that have already been built and trained by Google.

            Ai challenges: 
                ML production:
                    - scability
                    - monitoring 
                    - continuous integration and continuous delivery or deployment  

                ML tools ease-of-use:
                    - tools require advanced coding skills 
                    - take focus away from model configuration 
                    - no unified workflow 
                    - difficulties finding tools
