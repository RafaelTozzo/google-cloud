Google Cloud Computing Foundations: Infrastructure in Google Cloud


GC databases and storage services:

    Relational databases:

        - Cloud Storage (fully managed scalable service):
            common use cases:
                Binary large-object(BLOB) storage
                Online content 
                Backup and archiving 
                Storage of intermediate results
            
            Organized in buckets
            Bucket need a exclusive global name
            Specific geographic location to be store and min latency

            Have a option to active a "GIT" for version control
            Have a option to set lifeycle polices

            4 basic Cloud Storage classes:
                All classes have:
                    Unlimited storage(no mim object size)
                    Worldwide accessibility and locations
                    Low latency and high durability
                    A uniform experience
                    Geo-redundancy
                1 - Standard Storage: Hot data
                2 - Nearline Storage: Once per month
                3 - Coldline Storage: Once every 90 days
                4 - Archive Storage: Once a year

            Content storage and delivery
            Data analytics and general compute
            Backup and archival storage 

        - Cloud SQL:
            Suport:
                MySQL
                PostgreSQL
                SQL Server

        - Cloud Spanner:
                Applications that require:
                    built-in high availability
                    strong global consistency
                    database sizes tha exceed 2TB 
                    high numbers of input/output, and thousands of reads/writes per second
                Scales horizontally
                Stronglys consistent
                Speaks SQL


    NoSQL databases:
        - Firestore:
            Is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL document repository that accepts ACID transactions.
            Flexible
            Scales horizontally 
            for web, mobile, and server development


        - Bigtable
            Is a petabyte-scale sparse-column NoSQL database with low write latency.
            
            Handle massive workloads
            Consistent low latency 
            Hight throughput
            
            Great choice for:
                Operational applications 
                Analytical applications 

            Using APIs to read and write data:
                Data service layer:
                    Managed VMs 
                    HBase REST Server
                    Java Server 

            Streaming data into Bigtable:
                Stream processing frameworks:
                    Data flow
                    Spark Streaming 
                    Storm
            
            Using batch processes to read and write data:
                Batch processes:
                    - Hadoop MapReduce
                    - Dataflow
                    - Spark 


    Unstructured data:
        Usually used for:
            Documentes
            Images
            Audio files
        
        Databases:
            - Cloud Storage


    Structured:

        Transactional worload:
            SQL:
                Local/regional scability: Cloud SQL
                Global scability: Cloud Spanner           
            NoSQL: Firestore 
        
        Analytical workload:
            SQL: BigQuery 
            NoSQL: Cloud Bigtable 

        Tables 
        Rows 
        Columns
